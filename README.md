**Digital Representation of MR Images:**  
To start thinking about the digital representation of an MR image,  
start with visualizing a lattice of size IxJxK.

Cuboids for p=(i,j,k):
- The set C(p) represents the points (x, y, z) that lie within the cuboid.
- The cuboid is centered at the point p = (i, j, k).
- The half-lengths of its sides are denoted as h‚ÇÅ/2, h‚ÇÇ/2, and h‚ÇÉ/2.
- Mathematically, the set C(p) consists of points that satisfy the following conditions:

#### Triangular Mesh Representation
- By dividing each cuboid face into two triangles, we obtain a triangular mesh representation of boundaries
- A mesh is composed of: vertices, faces, edges, angles

#### Mesh Topology  
- Euler number: X = V+F-E V=number of vertices; F=number of faces; E=number of edges  
- Genus of meshes: g = number of holes  
- Relations between Euler number and g, X=2-2g  
- **Most common brain surfaces: genus-zero (spherical) topology**

Assignment: 
Let I denote an MRI image of size 256x256x256 with an isotropic resoluRon of 1mm. All the voxels are stored in the RAS orientaRon. Let p = (1,1,1) denote the voxel with a coordinate (1,1,1). 



# 2.Curvature 
| Learning Goals |

| <ul><li>Continuous and discrete definition of curves</li></ul>|
| <ul><li>Mathematical definition of tangent, normal, binormal, and curvature of curves</li></ul> |
| <ul><li>Discrete calculation of curvatures on curves in MATLAB</li></ul>   |

-Curvature describes the ‚Äúcurvedness‚Äù of shapes  
-Surface: how fast it deviates from a plane  
-Widely used for the geometric modeling of neuroanatomy  
-It is a local measure

### Curves ‚â† Curvature 
- The curvature of a surface is defined according to the curvature of curves
- Curves are by themselves useful geometric models in brain imaging,
for example, as seen in:
  
| Sulcal lines on cortical surfaces  |   Fiber tracts from tractography  |

|----------|------|-------------|
|A map from the real line to the 3D space, i.e., a curve C is parameterized by t‚ààR, and every point C(t)‚ààùëÖ^3If C(t)‚ààùëÖ^2, it is a planar curveIf C(a)=C(b), it is a closed curve. Special case: t is the arc length of the curve.edit/main/README.md  |      | A polyline is a discrete and ordered set of points in ùëÖ^3. In MATLAB, it is an array of size Nx3. N: number of points in the polyline Resample to segments of equal lengt Two vectors a and b, the length is norm(a-b).|
